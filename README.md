# Custom CMS for Morning Brew
## Elizabeth Chan

### Ideas for additional features:
o Style the pages to build a better UI
o Nest the stories model within a newsletter model so you can build "newsletters" (grouped by
date), each with multiple stories
o Use TinyMCE to clean the HTML input copy and pasted from a word document (you'll notice
when copy and pasting from a word document like Google Docs there is a ton of unnecessary HTML like <span> tags and random elements being styled...you'll need to enable code plugin to see it). Strip all styling and <span> tags.

I would continue the same color scheme as the Morning Brew website with a navigation bar that includes an admin dashboard, a list of metrics and analytics with built-in SEO tools, list of all available stories, a history of (a user's) past edits, project management tool (like Pivotal Tracker) and basic user settings. The list of all available stories would be nested as suggested in the additional features, but could also be organized by tag, by author and by amount of times it was opened/read. Since Morning Brew will possibly expand into non-business-oriented newsletters, the CMS can also divide the stories by theme as well. I would also change the layout of the edit page so that the form and the preview were side by side; I would then create a system that would change the preview live as you change the text boxes in the form.

Looking at other additional features, I would include some sort of social media integration so that it was easy to pull text from stories to be curated and created into social media posts. In the future when more graphics are added to the newsletters, the CMS would also be able to showcase a list of all graphics that can be added to the newsletter.


### Notes:
story content does not display properly on Preview page
